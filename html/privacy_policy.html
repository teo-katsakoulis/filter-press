    <h1>Privacy Policy for FilterPress</h1>
    <p>
      FilterPress is a browser extension designed to improve the readability of
      the comment section using Commento by allowing users to hide comments from
      specific usernames.
    </p>
    <p>
      This extension runs entirely on your device. It does
      <strong>not collect, store, or transmit any personal data</strong>. All
      settings, including your list of blocked usernames, are stored locally in
      your browser using Chrome's extension storage.
    </p>
    <p>
      FilterPress does not connect to any external servers, does not track user
      behavior, and does not display ads.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to the
      developer.
